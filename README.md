Hey there! Just wanted to share this amazing tool.
I spent hours trying to find a way to make the dashed border thing and though I found a lot of different ways to make it, none of them work for me,i did try to use the border property but it is not very customizable then I found this https://kovart.github.io/dashed-border-generator/ . Go and take a look.

Your challenge is to build out this conference ticket generator and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

    Complete the form with their details
    Receive form validation messages if:
        Any field is missed
        The email address is not formatted correctly
        The avatar upload is too big or the wrong image format
    Complete the form only using their keyboard
    Have inputs, form field hints, and error messages announced on their screen reader
    See the generated conference ticket when they successfully submit the form
    View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
    See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

Download the project and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project and help you get set up.
