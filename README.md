Hey there! Just wanted to share this amazing tool.
I spent hours trying to find a way to make the dashed border thing and though I found a lot of different ways to make it, none of them work for me,i did try to use the border property but it is not very customizable then I found this https://kovart.github.io/dashed-border-generator/ . Go and take a look.
